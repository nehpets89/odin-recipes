    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna-main.jpg" alt="A Beautiful Lasagna">
    <p>Create a classic lasagna, beautifully layered and presented on a deep blue plate. The lasagna is cut to reveal its rich, 
        meaty filling and the multiple layers of pasta sheets. The top layer is golden brown, likely from being baked with a layer of melted cheese,
        which has slightly crisped at the edges.
         The layers consist of a hearty meat sauce, which appears to be a traditional Bolognese made with ground beef, simmered in a tomato-based sauce.
         Interspersed between the meat sauce are creamy layers of what looks like ricotta cheese, giving the dish a rich and indulgent texture. 
         The lasagna noodles are perfectly cooked, holding the layers together without being too firm or too soft. The tomato sauce is generously spread throughout, 
         giving the dish a deep red hue that contrasts nicely with the pale pasta and the creamy cheese layers. The overall appearance is inviting, 
         with a comforting, homemade feel that suggests a flavorful and satisfying meal. This lasagna slice looks like it was cooked to perfection, 
         with each component complementing the other in both texture and flavor. </p>
