    <h1>Garlic Noodles</h1>
    <img src="../images/garlic-noodles.jpg" alt="A dish of garlic noodles">
    <p class="description">The noodles are perfectly cooked to an al dente texture, making them slightly firm to the bite, and they are generously coated with a golden-brown 
        sauce that gives them a glossy appearance. The sauce is likely made from a combination of ingredients such as soy sauce, oyster sauce, and a significant 
        amount of garlic, which is the star of the dish. The garlic is either finely minced or thinly sliced, saut√©ed until it becomes fragrant and slightly 
        caramelized, infusing the noodles with its robust flavor. The sauce clings to each strand of the noodles, ensuring every bite is packed with umami goodness. 
        Scattered over the top are small pieces of green onions, which add a fresh and mildly sharp contrast to the rich garlic flavor. There are also hints of red 
        chili flakes sprinkled throughout the dish, suggesting a subtle kick of heat that complements the savory sauce. The dish is served in a simple, neutral-toned 
        bowl, which allows the vibrant color of the noodles and garnishes to stand out, making it as visually appealing as it is appetizing. </p>
