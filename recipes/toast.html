    <h1>Toast</h1>
    <img src="../images/toast-main.jpg" alt="A beautiful slice of toast">
    <p>Create your own perfectly toasted bread, showcasing a golden-brown, evenly crisped surface. The bread has a slightly porous texture, with small, 
        evenly distributed air pockets that have browned beautifully during toasting, giving the slices an appealing crunch. The edges of the toast are slightly 
        darker, indicating that the bread has been toasted long enough to achieve a satisfying crispness without burning.
         The slices are arranged in a casual, overlapping manner on a rustic wooden surface, which contrasts nicely with the warm tones of the toast. 
         The light reflects off the surface of the bread, emphasizing its crisp texture and the even toasting, which is uniform across the slices.
         The toast itself appears to be made from white bread, given its light, soft interior that contrasts with the darker, toasted exterior. 
         The simplicity of the image, with its focus on the golden-brown toast, evokes a sense of warmth and comfort, suggesting that these slices are 
         ready to be enjoyed with a variety of toppings, such as butter, jam, or even as a base for more elaborate dishes like avocado toast or sandwiches. 
         The scene is inviting, hinting at the satisfying crunch that awaits in each bite. </p>
